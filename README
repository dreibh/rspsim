Welcome to the RSPSIM simulation model!

1. Directory Structure

 model/ - The model itself
 toolchain/ - The SimProcTC files for parametrisation, run distribution and
              post-processing of results


2. How to compile and run a simple model test

cd model/
opp_makemake -f
make
./model -f test1.ini

Have a look into test1.ini, the parameters should mostly be self-explaining.
A detailed introduction to the model can be found in T. Dreibholz,
"Reliable Server Pooling -- Evaluation, Optimization and Extension of a
Novel IETF Architecture" (Download at:
http://duepublico.uni-duisburg-essen.de/servlets/DocumentServlet?id=14969).


3. How to run a SimProcTC-based example?

cd toolchain
cd tools && make && cd ..
R --vanilla

Within the R shell:

source("example1.R")

This will parametrise the simulation defined in example1.R, perform all
runs (on the local machine) and collect the results.


source("plot-example1.R")

This will plot the results of example1. The resulting PDF file is
example1.pdf


Need more examples? Have a look into the directory example-scripts/.
Each <simulation>.R file is accompanied by the corresponding
plot-<simulation>.R to create the PDF output.


To distribute simulation runs in a compute pool, and for more details
on SimProcTC, see:
http://www.iem.uni-due.de/~dreibh/omnetpp/
All examples include the file computation-pool.R, where the pool
configuration has to be made!
